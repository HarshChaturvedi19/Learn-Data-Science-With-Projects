# Data Science Learning Journey

Welcome to my **Data Science Learning Journey** repository. This repository documents my progress as I study and apply the fundamental concepts of Data Science, from programming to advanced analytics techniques. It encompasses topics such as **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, **Data Manipulation with Pandas and Numpy**, **Data Visualization**, **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **SQL**, and **Statistical Concepts**.

---

## üöÄ **Learning Path**

The following topics will be explored in depth:

### 1. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python**
   - Principles of OOP: Classes, Objects, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, and Abstraction.
   - Practical implementation of these concepts in Python.

### 2. **Pandas**
   - Data manipulation, cleaning, and transformation using Pandas.
   - Handling missing data, merging, reshaping, and applying data operations.

### 3. **Numpy**
   - Efficient numerical computations using Numpy arrays.
   - Advanced mathematical operations, matrix algebra, and broadcasting.

### 4. **Advanced Pandas**
   - Deep dive into complex data wrangling techniques, time series handling, and performance optimization.

### 5. **Matplotlib & Seaborn**
   - Creating insightful data visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
   - Implementing various plots, including bar charts, scatter plots, line graphs, and heatmaps.

### 6. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Conducting comprehensive data analysis to uncover hidden patterns and relationships in datasets.
   - Generating summary statistics and visualizations for effective analysis.

### 7. **SQL**
   - Writing optimized SQL queries for data extraction, manipulation, and reporting.
   - Concepts of joins, subqueries, aggregations, and window functions.

### 8. **Statistics & Probability**
   - Core statistical concepts, including hypothesis testing, distributions, and sampling techniques.
   - Introduction to probability theory and its application in data analysis.

## üìö **Course Materials and Resources**

This repository is primarily based on the **Campus 1.0** course by **Nitish Singh**. The course offers a structured approach to learning Data Science, and I am using it as a guide to build a solid foundation in this field.  

I will continue to update this repository with notes, code implementations, and project files related to each topic.
